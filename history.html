      content="St.Theresa, also called The Little Flower of Jesus, was a French national. Most Rev. Henry Prunier, the first Bishop of Salem, and a member of the French Foreign Mission Society, started the school and named it The Little Flower School. Mr. Foulks, the then Salem District Collector, inaugurated it on 05.06.1930. Rev. Fr. Raymond Henry Mischotte was the first Headmaster and the school started functioning with 146 students, seven teachers and one clerk. The Motto of the school is Lead Kindly Light and the Golden Words for the students are I am proud of my school and the school is proud of me. The Brothers of St. Gabriel, (Montfort Brothers) took charge of the school in 1932 and a first batch of 13 students wrote the government public exam. The Fathers of The Society of Jesus were in charge of the school between 1936 and 1950. During these years, the school grew enormously in the field of education, discipline, games and cultural activities. The Independence day of August 15, 1947 was celebrated with the veteran freedom fighter, Sri. Varadarajulu Naidu, as the chief guest. He hoisted the national flag. Since 1950, the Salem Diocesan Priests have been in charge of the school. In 1978 it became a higher second-ary school. A total of 100 teachers, clerks and assistants serve the school. There are 3,544 students now."

                  shifted to the High school in June 1932. The diocese of Salem
                  requested the Brothers of St. Gabriel to manage the school.
                  These brothers managed it till December 1935. Bro. Corentin
                  was the Correspondent and Mr. Norbert George, The Headmaster.
                  The school was handed over to the Jesuits of Madurai Province
                  in Jan 1936. Rev. F. J. M. Arulnather S. J. was the Headmaster
                  and Correspondent. Under the administration of the Jesuits,
                  the strength increased and in a couple of years, the
                  admissions had to be a restricted due to the limited
                  accommodation.

                  Most Rev. Vemani S. Selvanather, D.D., D.C.L., the first
                  Indian Bishop of Salem, turned over the management of the
                  School to the Salem diocesan fathers. The school grew and
                  became one of the leading educational institutions of Salem
                  and of the state. Strength in both the high school and the
                  elementary school grew enormously. An English Medium Nursery
                  was started to feed the English Medium section of the high
                  school. The diocese immediately sponsored educational
                  improvement proposed by the Government and the school became
                  Little Flower Multipurpose School with Engineering and
                  Agriculture as vocational courses. For some years, to fill up
                  the dearth of teachers, the Little Flower High School trained
                  teachers, offering short course. Mid-day meals, a Book bank,
                  and school uniforms were all introduced in tune with the
                  proposals of the Chief Ministers of Tamilnadu.

                  coreespondent in June 1950. Fr. V.S.Pushpanather not only
                  changed the policies of his predecessors slowly and steadily
                  changed the very look of the school building in his long
                  tenure of twenty three years. Rev. Fr. V. S. Pushpanather was
                  a loving father. He readily offered help to everyone who
                  approached him for help. He rightly earned reverence from
                  everyone who came in contact with him. To him 'Duty is
                  Worship'. Under his able leadership the school earned laurels
                  both in the curricular and extra curricular spheres. He
                  introduced diversified courses, which paved the way for the
                  introduction of vocational studies for the Higher Secondary
                  students. He was a good hockey and football player. He
                  organized "Victory Day" in the school to encourage winners in
                  games and sports. Rev. Fr. V.S. Pushpanather stood for values
                  such as devotion to duty and discipline. A new science
                  laboratory was built with the contribution of the public and
                  was named "Pushpam Hall" to commemorate his Sacerdotal Silver
                  Jubilee. He earned a great reputation for the school. He also
                  earned the Tamil Nadu State Award, "The Best Teacher" in
                  recognition of his meritorious service. He retired in 1973.
